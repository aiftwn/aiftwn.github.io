In my Lifeti.me
======================

A blog to blog because I need to work on my writing skills, as well as document my cool ideas and their implementations.


Features
-------

* **My ramblings** — Have a look into my adhd-riddled mind and be witness to my psuedo-grand ideas that will change the world. 
* **Artificial Intelligence** — This blog will include some things about artificial intelligence. Apparently blogging about your programming work makes you a better programmer. But I'm doing this to keep a check on my race to pursue a career in AI.
* **Chess** — May or may not include stuff about chess. Or even applications of AI in chess.
